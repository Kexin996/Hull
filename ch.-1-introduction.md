# Ch. 1 Introduction

## 1.1     EXCHANGE-TRADED MARKETS

* derivatives: **a financial instrument whose value derives from the values of other, more basic, underlying variables**
  * **that could be any variable**
* derivative exchange: a place where people trade standardized contracts defined by the exchange.
* exchange clearing house: takes deposits from the two parties in the contracts to **eliminate credit risks.**

****

### Electronic Market

* computers to pair with the buyers and sellers



## 1.2   OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS

* not traded on exchanges
  * **maybe some smaller companies that don't meet the requirement of exchange listing --->** <mark style="color:blue;">risker</mark>
  * **the exchange listing also costs money**
* participants: banks, funds, financial institution
* **smaller volume**
* once a OTC trade has been agreed,
  * central counter party (CCP):
    * that works like exchange clearing house ---> **lower risks**
    * e.g. brokers
  * bilateral clearing: two parties sign an agreement ---> **assessment of risks**
* new regulations:
  * standardized OTC derivatives in US must be traded on a **swap execution facilities** (SEFs).
    * where market participants can post bid, off quotes, and where market participants can choose to accept quotes of other participants.
  * requirement to use CCP.
  * all trades be reported to a central registry
* systematic default: ripple effects



### Market Size

* average size of transactions in OTC > average size of transactions on exchange
* OTC > exchange
* Principal of an OTC != the value of transaction
  * <mark style="color:blue;">the principal is only the money for the underlying assets</mark>



## 1.3    FORWARD CONTRACTS

* **definition: agrees to buy/sell a certain asset at a predetermined rate in a certain date**
  * contrast: spot price ---> buy/sell immediately
* **OTC** ---> between financial institutions or between a financial institution and one of it clients.
* long position ---> agrees to buy the underlying asset
* short position ---> agrees to sell the underlying asset
* popular in **foreign exchange**
* **hedge foreign currency risks**



### Payoffs from Forward Contracts

* payoff of an asset from a long position in a forward contract:
  * Spot price at maturity - Delivery price
* payoff of an asset from a short position in a forward contract:
  * Delivery price - Spot price at maturity
* it can be negative or positive ---> **the contract is an obligation**

### Forward Prices and Spot Prices

* the total money to delivery at the maturity



## 1.4    FUTURES CONTRACTS

* similar to forward contracts, but traded on **exchange**
* two parties ---> unknown to each other



## 1.5    OPTIONS

* OTC + exchange
* call option:
  * gives **the holder the right to buy an asset as a certain date (expiration date / maturity) at a predetermined price (exercise price / strike price)**
* put option:&#x20;
  * gives **the holder the right to sell an asset as a certain date (expiration date / maturity) at a predetermined price (exercise price / strike price)**
* American option: be exercised **at any time up to the expiration time**
  * **most of the options traded on exchange**
* European option: be exercised only at maturity&#x20;
* one option contract: an agreement to buy / sell 100 shares in the **exchanged-traded equity option market**
* **no cost for futures/ forward, but a cost for entering an option**
* bid-ask spread:
  * market maker buys at ask, and sells at bid
  * price taker buys at bid, sells at ask
* **option's bid-ask spread > stocks bid-ask spread**
* <mark style="color:blue;">I spend the cost of option to get the right to buy / sell an asset at a specific price and date ---> option price is one of the costs.</mark>
* **seller of options ---> must fulfill the obligation of the buyers of options choose to exercise it**

* **selling of an option: writing an option**



## 1.6     HEDGERS

* **avoid exposure** to adverse price movement



### Hedging Using Forward Contracts

* no guarantee
* fix the price to neutralize risk ---> no choice, you have to do it



### Hedge Using Options

* insurance ---> you can do exercise or you don't
* cons: **beginning fees**



## 1.7    SPECULATORS

* take a position



### Speculation Using Futures

* buy at spot price:
  * the asset will be placed in a warehouse with **interest rate**
  * huge upfront cost
* buy a future contract:
  * you only need to deposit **small amount of money** in the margin account ---> **leverage**



### Speculation Using Options

* leverage ---> **magnify both the losses and gains**



### Comparison

* **futures losses are unlimited, but options losses are limited to upfront costs**



## 1.8    ARBITRAGEURS

* **lock in profits** by **entering two or more markets at the same time**
* transaction cost ---> **eliminate small investors, but good for big investment banks**
* supply and demand ---> **arbitrages opportunities small and short**
* futures



## &#x20;1.9 DANGERS

* **versatility of derivatives - mix, dangers**
  * **mandate to hedge / arbitrage ---> may be speculators**
